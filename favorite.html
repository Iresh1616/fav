      <div style="margin-top: -220px;"><p style="font-size: 20px;margin-left: 400px;"> Hardik Pandya was born on 11 October 1993 in Choryasi, Surat, Gujarat. His father, Himanshu Pandya, ran a small car finance business in Surat which he shut down and moved to Vadodara when Hardik was five to provide his sons with better cricket training facilities. Himanshu Pandya worked as a loan consultant in Vadodara.[3] He enrolled his two sons into Kiran More's cricket academy in Vadodara.[4] Lacking finances, the Pandya family lived in a rented apartment in Gorwa, with the brothers using a second-hand car to travel to the cricket ground.[3] Hardik studied at the MK High School until ninth grade before dropping out to focus on cricket.[5]
Pandya made steady progress in junior-level cricket, and according to Krunal, "won a lot of matches single-handedly" in club cricket.[4] In an interview with the Indian Express, Hardik said that he was dropped from his state age-group teams due to his "attitude problems". He added that he was "just an expressive child" who did not "like to hide his emotions."[6]

<div style="margin-left: 400px;font-size: 20px;margin-top: -350px;"><p>Rohit Sharma, widely known as the "Hitman" of Indian cricket, is one of the most talented and admired cricketers in the world. Born on April 30, 1987, in Nagpur, Maharashtra, Rohit rose from a humble background to become one of the greatest batsmen in the history of the game. His cricketing journey is a story of patience, hard work, and perseverance. From being a young boy with a dream to the captain of the Indian cricket team, his life is an inspiration to millions.
Rohit Sharma began his career as an off-spinner, but his coach soon recognized his potential with the bat and encouraged him to focus on batting. He made his international debut in 2007 and was part of the Indian team that won the inaugural T20 World Cup that same year. Although he showed promise early on, his real breakthrough came in 2013 when he was promoted to open the innings in One Day Internationals (ODIs). This decision transformed his career and he went on to achieve records that no other cricketer has managed. He became the only player in the world to score three double centuries in ODIs, with his highest score being an astonishing 264 runs against Sri Lanka, which remains the highest individual score in ODI history.

<div style="margin-left: 400px;margin-top: -320px;font-size :20px;"><p>Narendra Modi, the 14th and current Prime Minister of India, is one of the most influential and dynamic political leaders the country has ever seen. Born on September 17, 1950, in Vadnagar, a small town in Gujarat, Narendra Damodardas Modi comes from a humble background. His early life was marked by struggle and dedication. He helped his father sell tea at a railway station and later ran a tea stall with his brother. Despite facing financial difficulties, he remained determined and committed to serving the nation.
Modi's political journey began in his youth when he joined the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a nationalist organization. His hard work and leadership skills soon caught the attention of senior leaders, and he eventually became a prominent figure in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). In 2001, he became the Chief Minister of Gujarat, a position he held for over a decade. During his tenure, Gujarat saw significant economic growth, infrastructure development, and improvements in governance, which earned him both praise and criticism. His "Gujarat Model" of development became widely discussed across the country.
In 2014, Narendra Modi led the BJP to a historic victory in the general elections and became the Prime Minister of India. His campaign focused on development, good governance, and nationalism, with the slogan "Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas" (Together with all, development for all). As Prime Minister, he introduced several landmark initiatives such as Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Mission), Make in India, Digital India, Ujjwala Yojana, Jan Dhan Yojana, and Startup India. These programs aimed at improving sanitation, boosting manufacturing, increasing digital connectivity, providing LPG connections to poor households, and promoting entrepreneurship.

He began his Indian Premier League (IPL) career with Mumbai Indians in 2012 but rose to fame during his time with Kolkata Knight Riders. He later returned to Mumbai Indians in 2018, where he became a key player and helped the team win IPL titles. His stylish shots, quick scoring, and ability to play all around the field earned him the nickname “Mr. 360°,” similar to South Africa’s AB de Villiers.
